# Trading-with-Machine-Learning
Use supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to trade stocks. Methods used: (1) Logistic regression neural network, (2) Neural network, (3) Deep neural network, (4) K means algorithm, (5) K nearest neighborhood, (6) Support vector machine, (7) Decision tree, and (8) Random forest.

The code is partly based on Dr. Param Jeet's and Prashan Vats' book 'Learning Quantitative Finance with R'. I recommend it for those interested on learning more complex coding skills related to Quantitative Finance.
